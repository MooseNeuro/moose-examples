# Examples, tutorials, and demo scripts for MOOSE

These are example scripts for model setup and simulation with MOOSE.

# How to run

These examples need MOOSE to be installed: https://github.com/MooseNeuro/moose-core

Make sure that you have `matplotlib`, and `scipy` (optional) installed as well.

Some scripts like the `squid demo` and `Izhikevich models demo` require `PyQt` for graphical interface.
